# Galaxy Code Challenge Frontend Application

This is the frontend for the code challenge. It is created using VueJS and Bulma.


## Project setup
```
git clone git@github.com:RogerVR1994/galaxy-front.git

cd galaxy-front

# Install all node modules necessary for the application to run
npm install

# Run the app
npm run serve
```

This will create an application in [localhost:8080] where you will be able to create and retrieve data 
from the Django app.

It is important that the 2 applications are running at the same time.
